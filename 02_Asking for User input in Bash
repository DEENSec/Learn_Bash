02_Asking for User Input in Bash

Why use user input?
Bash scripts become powerful when they interact with users. Using read, we can prompt users for input and store their responses in variables.

ðŸ“œ Script Example

#!/bin/bash

# Asking for user input
echo "What is your first name?"
read firstname

echo "What is your last name?"
read lastname

# Output the full name
echo "Hello, $firstname $lastname!"

ðŸ§  Explanation

| Command     | Description                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `echo`      | Prints text to the screen                      |
| `read var`  | Waits for user input and stores it in `var`    |
| `$variable` | Used to display the value stored in a variable |

ðŸ§ª Try It Yourself

1.Save the script as name_input.sh.

2. Make it executable:

   chmod +x name_input.sh

3. Run it

   ./name_input.sh

4. Try entering
   
   First name: jhon  
   Last name: alex  

5. You'll see 

   Hello, jhon alex!


You can Also read multiple inputs in one line

ex: read firstname lastname

It will ask once and split the inputs based on spaces
