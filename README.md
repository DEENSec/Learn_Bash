## 01. Bash Scripting Starter

### What is this?
Every Bash script must start with a shebang (#!) line to tell the system which interpreter to use.

### 游댳Basic Format

#!/bin/bash
This line tells your system to use the Bash shell (located at /bin/bash) to run the script.

### 游댳Explanation

#!/usr/bin/env bash
