## 🔹__Bash Scripting Starter__

### What is this?
Every Bash script must start with a shebang (#!) line to tell the system which interpreter to use.

### 🔹Basic Format

#!/bin/bash
This line tells your system to use the Bash shell (located at /bin/bash) to run the script.

### 🔹Explanation


| Part        | Meaning                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `#!`        | Called the **shebang**                                 |
| `/bin/bash` | Path to the **Bash interpreter** on most Linux systems |



### 🔹Try It Yourself


01. open a terminal.

02. Create a script.

🟢 nano hello.sh

03. Add.

#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, world!"

04. Save and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).

05. Make it executable

🟢 chmod +x hello.sh

06. Run it

## 🔹Tip

Use #!/usr/bin/env bash if you're writing scripts that need to be portable across different systems (e.g., not all have /bin/bash).

#!/usr/bin/env bash
