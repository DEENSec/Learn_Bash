## 01. Bash Scripting Starter

### What is this?
Every Bash script must start with a shebang (#!) line to tell the system which interpreter to use.

### 游댳Basic Format

#!/bin/bash
This line tells your system to use the Bash shell (located at /bin/bash) to run the script.

### 游댳Explanation


| Part        | Meaning                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `#!`        | Called the **shebang**                                 |
| `/bin/bash` | Path to the **Bash interpreter** on most Linux systems |



### 游댳Try It Yourself


游릭 step 01: open a terminal.

游릭 Step 02: Create a script.

          nano hello.sh

游릭 Step 03: Add this code inside the file

         #!/bin/bash
         echo "Hello, world!"

游릭 step 04: Save and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).

游릭 step 05: Make it executable

        chmod +x hello.sh

游릭 step 06: Run it

        ./hello.sh

#### 游댮Output

    Hello, world!

### 游댳Tip

Use #!/usr/bin/env bash if you're writing scripts that need to be portable across different systems (e.g., not all have /bin/bash).

#!/usr/bin/env bash








## 02. Asking for User Input in Bash

### Why use user input?
Bash scripts become powerful when they interact with users. Using read, we can prompt users for input and store their responses in variables.

### Script Example 

    #!/bin/bash

### Asking for user input
    echo "What is your first name?"
    read firstname

    echo "What is your last name?"
    read lastname

### Output the full name
    
    echo "Hello, $firstname $lastname!"

### Explanation 

| Command     | Description                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `echo`      | Prints text to the screen                      |
| `read var`  | Waits for user input and stores it in `var`    |
| `$variable` | Used to display the value stored in a variable |

### Try It Yourself 

游릭 step 01: Save the script as name_input.sh.

游릭 step 02: Make it executable:

    chmod +x name_input.sh

游릭 step 03: Run it
 
    ./name_input.sh

游릭 step 04: Try entering
   
    First name: jhon  
    Last name: alex  

游댮 step 05: You'll see 

    Hello, jhon alex!


You can Also read multiple inputs in one line

    ex: read firstname lastname

It will ask once and split the inputs based on spaces
